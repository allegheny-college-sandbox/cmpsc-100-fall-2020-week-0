    "\n",
    "Markdown is simply a set of rules governing a document which emphasizes the _structure_ of a document over formatting. We'll call these rules a \"syntax\" (this word means that there's a formal way of \"speaking\" Markdown; don't forget that all written/spoken languages have a syntax, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the acknowledged creator of Markdown, it's supposed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> make [documents] as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivation saves you from needing to open Microsoft Word or create a Google Doc just to make a simple document. Here, you can do it quickly in just a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as many folks correctly note -- when one says they use \"Markdown,\" it's a bit confusing. In our courses, because we use GitHub, we use [GitHub \"flavored\" Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "(The above-linked guide is the official \"getting started\" guide from GitHub.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where do we use Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown appears on its own (in files called `.md` files) or in Jupter notebooks -- like the one you're seeing _right now_. In fact, if you double-click this cell, you'll see what the Markdown looks like behind all of this writing.\n",

In 2020 a professor attempted to boggle their students' minds by sending them a game in which they hid a Golden Python whose scales were conjured from digital textâ€”an enterprising computer system seized this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Python remains a mystery to this day...

It is hidden somewhere in the `/mansion`, but it is up to _you_ to find and `claim` it.
